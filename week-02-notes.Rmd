# Problem Definition & Objectives

+ Deeper dive into project management
+ Defining your project
    
    + Understand what it is you're trying to solve
    + What are the objectives you seek to fulfill
    + What do you want to do and what don't you want to do

+ Problem Definition

    + Get to the root cause - 5 why analysis
    + What are the challenges that must be faced with this project?
    + The problem definition will allow everyone to be on the same page as the direction of the project. 
        + Problem Statement == Problem Definition
        
+ 5W1H Approach

    + Who / What / Where / When / Why / How
    
+ Problem Definition Checklist

    + **Pain** <- I know the consequences of not addressing the issue
    + **Real** <- The problem is not an anomaly; it has been acknowledged by a number of people
    + **Obvious** <- the importance of the problem is clear to all who read it, even if they are not familiar with the situation
    + **Bound** <- I know where the problem begins and ends
    
+ Good Examples: 

    + In the last year, we have 30% of customer switch carriers, which lost our company over $40,000 in revenue
        + Quantitiative measures that define what the problem is
        
+ Project Objectives

    + What do you plan to achieve by the end of the project?
        + Deliverables
        + Assets
        + Intangible assets
    + Be specific in the objectives using quantitative language
    

![](objectives_vs_goals.png)

+ Objectives: define what you want and how to do it
+ Goal: more high level focused on business objectievs

![](project_objectives.png)

+ defined when we want it to get done
+ define quantitative measure
+ define objectives clearly

+ Project Requirements

    + Once the problem definition is created and the objectives are defined, we need to determine the requirements so that we can define the project scope
    

# Requirements

+ Project Requirements

    + Can be applied to analytics projects
    + Provieds good overview picture of what sort of challenges could arise
    
+ Traditional Software Requirements

    + Act as bridge between IT and Business
        + No need for this since analytics projects, both roles are the same people
    + Provide information on what exactly the system should do
        + Little ambiguity exists in the team about what the purpose of the system 
    + No formal testing in analytics projects
    + Builders and users both understand the degree of success from the project by looking at the results
    + Having a clear definition of success (knowing where the project ends) is imperative
    
+ Requirements Extraction

    + Source systems involved
    + Business processes involved
    + User and business sophistication
    + Important data entitites

# Project Scope & Risk Assessment

+ Project scope allows a defined boundary of what to include and not to include in the project
+ Using the requirements, scope can be determined from the solutions and requirements previously chosen
+ Scope Creep <- when features continue to be added to a project and delay its expected release date

+ Project scope statement

    + offers clear guidance on the intentions and scope of the project

+ Project Deliverables

    + Working Models to run on new data to predict new customer churn
    + Dashboard to display the predicted customer churn
    + Dashboard to display historical customer churn
    
+ Acceptable Criteria: 
    
    + Successful implementation of deliverables
    + Positive results seen from using predictive analysis in the future
    
+ Constraints and Exclusions:

    + Constrained by the overwhelming amount of data. Needs to be reduced to most important variables
    + Constrained by time schedule of 10 weeks
    + Exclusion based around needing to predict beyond the next 6-months of churn
    + Assumptions: 
        + Data given isup to date and based on accurate data
        + Budget is $250,000

+ Risk Assessment

    + Anticipating problems and risks will prevent delays and hang ups in the future
    + Identifying risks randomly in a brainstorming session can be detrimental
    + Better to draw up a list of categories and assign risks identified from previous projects into these

+ Phases of Risk Assessment

    + Risk identification 
        + Compile list of risks from previous projects
        + Identify common risks
        + State cause, the risk itself, and the effect on the project
            + "The risk of there being too many features to use in models will make it so thtat dimensionality prevents predictive analysis" 
    + Categorize and Group Duplicates
        + Identify duplicate risks and triggers other risks
        + "Too much data risk - category: data preprocessing risk" 
    + Qualify Risks (Assign Probabiliy and Impact of each)
        + What is the risk - how will I recognize it when I see it
        + What is probability of it actually happening?
        + How serious of a threat does it pose?
        + "We will see it when we attempt to run models on the data and the time to complete is impractical. It is moderately probable, and it poses a high threat unless dealt with"
    + Determine Risk Response Phase
        + Risk score
        + Find practical solution to deal with the risk
        + "Find feature reduction solution or fi its too much rows, find numerosity reduction solution" 
    + Document Risk Phase
        + Maintain Risk Register to track throughout the project to ensure action is taken
        + Risk reevaluation may be added to project timeline to maintain awareness around all risks.
